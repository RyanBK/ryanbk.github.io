Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of California, Los Angeles.  

I study how real-world events interact with votersâ€™ partisan attachments to shape elections and public opinion in the United States. My research investigates when voters' attitudes and political behavior are influenced by changing societal conditions, especially changes in their local environment. In particular, my research focuses on those voters who live closest to focusing events, are exposed to salient policy changes, and or whose local communities experience worsening policy outcomes. 

My dissertation primarily focuses on an extended case study of mass shootings, investigating whether these salient events affect voters' political attitudes and behavior. This research applies rigorous causal inference techniques to large-scale survey data and administrative databases while using survey experimens to test specific mechanisms and scope conditions. This dissertation work is supported by a $15,000 Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship from the [Rapoport Family Foundation](www.rapoportfamilyfoundation.com). I am also a member of [the Practical Causal Inference  Lab](www.practicallycausal.com).

More broadly, I am generally interested in electoral accountability, political participation, policy feedback, and representation -- especially when these questions intersect with public health. I have experience collaborating across disciplinary boundaries, including with researchers and practitioners in medicine, public health, and psychology. These collaborations often provide unique opportunities to advance literatures in multiple disciplines while contributing timely insights to ongoing public policy discussions. Currently, I am part of the UCLA Health and Politics Project, an interdisciplinary collaboration between social scientists and medical doctors at UCLA and Harvard. I have also published collaborative work with researchers at the Centers for Disease Control. 

Before starting graduate school at UCLA, I worked in public health and healthcare. At the [AIDS Institute](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/){:target="_blank"}, New York State Department of Health, I worked in Office of the Medical Director on quality of care initiatives. I also worked as a data analyst at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/){:target="_blank"} in the Department of Strategy and Innovation. 

My CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/baxter_king_cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  

The syllabus for a course that I developed, "Health, Politics, and Culture: Medicare and Medicaid Policy" is available [here](Medicare and Medicaid Syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
