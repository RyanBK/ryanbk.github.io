I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of California, Los Angeles. Before starting graduate school at UCLA, I worked in public health and healthcare. At the [AIDS Institute](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/){:target="_blank"}, New York State Department of Health, I worked in Office of the Medical Director on quality of care initiatives. I also worked as a data analyst at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/){:target="_blank"} in the Department of Strategy and Innovation. 

I am broadly interested in electoral accountability, retrospective voting, voter learning -- especially when these questions intersect with public health and healthcare. Currently, I am part of an interdisciplinary team at UCLA studying the political and health consequences of COVID-19. I also am involved in a project on the electoral implications of the opioid epidemic.
